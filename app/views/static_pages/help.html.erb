  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p> 
      Where is the log out button? <br />
      The log out button is located in the drop-down menu that is accessed by clicking on your email. It is located in the top right corner of every page (including this one), in the header. <br /> <br />
      How long am I logged into my account? <br />
      You are logged into your account unless you log out manually. This was designed for the ease of the user (likely you) but can be less secure. Please log out after each session unless you are sure your computer is secure and never give out your password to anyone. <br /> <br />
      I forgot my password, is there a way I can access my account? <br />
      Yes, this is a common occurence. Simply go to the log in page and click the Reset password link. This link will send an email to your account email with a form to fill out for a new password. <br /> <br />
      I deleted or my email provider deleted my validation email, what can I do? <br />
      Go to the log in page and click the link for resending a validation email, then check your email and spam folders.
